# Building and locations

This section will guide you through the navigation and use of location hierachy. This is where you maintain a digital representation of your location(s).

From here you can:
- Add, edit and view which locations you have setup
- Add, edit and view which sensors are installed
- View aggregated data about specific locations
- View raw data from the sensors
